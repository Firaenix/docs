The Money Button API is similar to other web services like GitHub and Twitter.
In order to make full use of the API, you must create an "app" in your user
settings. When creating a new app, you will be be able to pick a few properties,
such as the name of your app, and you will also be given a few pre-generated
values. Every user has a default app.

The values for an app are:

| property           | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| App Name           | The name of your application, like "My Cool App". Can be any short string.                                                                                                                                                       |
| App URL            | The website URL where your app can be found. Or, if your app is not a web app, this should be your company's home page where a link to download your app can be found.                                                           |
| App Description    | A short description of your app such as "A way to post files to the blockchain."                                                                                                                                                 |
| Client Identifier  | An autogenerated random string that identifies your app. This number should be added to every button to allow you to track payments made in your app and to receive webhooks. This value is public and can be shared with users. |
| Client Secret      | An autogenerated random string that must be kept secret. Do not share this secret with your users. The client secret is how you can access the Money Button REST API.                                                            |
| Webhook URL        | When a payment is received, confirmed, and/or failed, you will receive a webhook notification at this URL.                                                                                                                       |
| Webhook Secret     | An autogenerated (but editable) random string that is sent with webhooks so that you can confirm the webhook came from Money Button directly.                                                                                    |
| OAuth Identifier   | An autogenerated random string that is used client-side (in the web browser) to allow users to authenticate ("sign in with Money Button").                                                                                       |
| OAuth Redirect URL | When the users sign in with Money Button, they will be redirected back to your website at this URL.                                                                                                                              |

Once you have created an app, you will be able to use the
[api-client](api-client.html) to interface with the REST API,
[webhooks](api-webhooks.html) to receive payment updates, and
[OAuth](api-oauth.html) to authenticate users and get permission to perform
actions on their behalf.
