Money Button has a powerful API that allows you to accept secure webhooks
server-side to confirm payments, to authenticate users to remember purchases or
to allow users to engage with other users, and get permission from users to
perform actions and get information on their behalf.

The first step to use the Money Button API is to [make a new app](api-apps.md).
Once you have made an app, you will be able to [use webhooks to receive payment
notifications](api-webhooks.md) in a secure way server-side, and you will also
be able to use the [api-client (in a browser or node.js) in order to access the
REST API](api-client.md) or the [OAuth API](api-oauth.md).
